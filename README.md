# Simulation-of-a-Flux-Switching-Permanent-Magnet-machine-and-Drive
This repository consists of the Ansys Maxwell and Simplorer files implemented during a Final Year Project related to the simulation of a FSPM machine and Drive. 

The project was ran on Ansys2019R1 and it should be noted that the files attached will not run at any lower version of Ansys. 
Additionally, the user is advised to ensure that they are connected to the UCT network when running Ansys.

Lastly, the file for the Ansys Maxwell File for the FSPM machine is written My_FSPM.aedt and the file for the drive is written Working_WO_real_Machine.aedt
